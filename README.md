* Download and install AltServer from [here](https://altstore.io)

* Right click on the AltServer icon with your phone connected and choose "Install Altstore", then the name of your phone. When prompted sign in with your Apple ID. Two-factor Authentication is supported, app-specific passwords are not.

### Note

* Signing with a non developer account will have the app expire in 7 days, but Altstore automates re-signing as long as it is connected to your PC.
* The app will not receive Push Notifications.
* If you're getting "Error 200" then try using another signing service/method. For **appdb pro** users, please change **Identity type to use for appdb PRO** in the [appdb configuration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52943116/134609634-80155411-ef73-4c5a-89d3-263cf94602dc.PNG) from **Auto** to **Development**, then re-install uYou. After that, you can set it back to **Auto**.
