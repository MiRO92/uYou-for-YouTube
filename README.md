## How to Sideload on non-jailbroken devices
### Requirements
1. A computer running macOS or Windows
2. Internet connection
3. Apple ID (email & password)


### AltStore
* Download and install AltServer from [here](https://altstore.io).

* Right-click on the AltServer icon with your phone connected and choose "Install Altstore", then the name of your phone. When prompted sign in with your Apple ID. Two-factor Authentication is supported, but app-specific passwords are not.

* Option 1
    * Copy the link below then open it in Safari.
    * `altstore://install?url=https://miro92.com/repo/depictions/com.miro.uyou/iPA/YouTube_18.29.1_uYou_3.0.1.ipa`
* Option 2
    * Download the IPA/ZIP file from the link above.
    * Copy the IPA file to your device, using iCloud Drive, Airdrop, or any other method.
    * Open AltStore and navigate to the "My Apps" tab.
    * Choose the plus sign button located in the top right corner and open the IPA file.
    * When prompted sign in with your Apple ID. Two-factor Authentication is supported, but app-specific passwords are not.


## Note

* Signing with a non-developer account will have the app expire in 7 days, but Altstore automates re-signing as long as it is connected to your PC.
* The app will not receive Push Notifications.
* If you're getting **"Error 200"** after signing with AppDB Pro then you need to change the `Identity type to use for appdb PRO` in the [appdb configuration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52943116/134609634-80155411-ef73-4c5a-89d3-263cf94602dc.PNG) from `Auto` to `Development`. After that, you can set it back to Auto if you want.
